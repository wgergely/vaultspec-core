# `vault-doctor-suite` adr: Vault Doctor Suite Architecture | (**status:** `accepted`)

## Problem Statement

The vault verification system grew organically around `vault audit`. That command is now
feature-saturated and is removed. Several check domains (graph invalid-links, orphan detection)
exist in isolation and are not wired into any user-facing command. Critical gaps remain around
chain integrity, frontmatter format drift, and fix safety. The existing `fix_violations()` function
modifies files without a dry-run mode. A coherent replacement architecture is needed that can host
new check domains, expose them composably, and work cleanly with pre-commit hooks.

## Considerations

### Option 1 — Expand `vault audit` Flags

Add more flags to the existing `vault audit` command (`--chain-check`, `--link-check`, etc.) and
expand `fix_violations()` with a `dry_run` parameter.

**Pro:** Minimal surface area change.
**Con:** `audit` is already overloaded and is being removed. Adding more flags to a command slated
for removal is counter-productive. The audit command is not structured to register checks dynamically.

### Option 2 — New `vault doctor` Subcommand with Registered Checks

Introduce `vaultspec vault doctor` as the sole dedicated command for vault content health. Doctor
checks are individually registered and addressable by name or category. The command supports
`--dry-run`, `--fix`, `--input`, `--check`, `--severity`, and `--json`.

**Pro:** Clean separation of concerns, composable, extensible. Pre-commit hooks pass staged files
via `--input` or positional args. Severity model is native to the command design. No legacy surface
to maintain.
**Con:** New CLI surface to document and maintain.

### Option 3 — Standalone Doctor Module Called by Both CLI Paths

A `doctor/` module invoked by both `vault audit --verify` (backward compat) and a new
`vault doctor` command.

**Pro:** Reuses existing integration point while enabling a richer interface.
**Con:** `vault audit` is removed — there is no dual-path to support. This option is moot.

## Implementation

**Adopt Option 2.**

`vaultspec vault doctor` is the primary and sole interface for vault content health checks.
`vault audit` is removed entirely — no shim, no deprecation notice, no sunsetting period.

The doctor suite introduces a `src/vaultspec/doctor/` module:

```
src/vaultspec/doctor/
├── __init__.py           — public exports
├── registry.py           — check registration and suite runner
├── models.py             — DoctorResult, Severity, CheckCategory
├── checks/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── links.py          — broken wikilinks, orphan detection
│   ├── chain.py          — plan→adr, adr→research, exec→plan chain integrity
│   ├── drift.py          — frontmatter format drift (dates, features, CRLF, etc.)
│   ├── coverage.py       — per-feature doc-type coverage matrix
│   └── structure.py      — stray files, unsupported dirs (delegates to existing api)
└── fixes/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── safe_writer.py    — atomic write with dry-run support
    └── frontmatter.py    — frontmatter normalization fixes (dry-run aware)
```

### Three-Mode Contract

| Mode | Invocation | Reads | Writes | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **report** (default) | `vault doctor` | yes | no | issue list |
| **preview** | `vault doctor --fix --dry-run` | yes | no | what *would* change |
| **modify** | `vault doctor --fix` | yes | yes | issue list + applied changes |

`--dry-run` is only meaningful with `--fix`. Without `--fix`, `--dry-run` is rejected with an
error. The default mode is always safe — no writes without `--fix`.

### Check Registry Design

```python
@dataclass
class DoctorCheck:
    name: str                  # e.g. "exec-plan-chain"
    category: CheckCategory    # LINKS | CHAIN | DRIFT | COVERAGE | STRUCTURE
    severity: Severity         # ERROR | WARNING | INFO
    fixable: bool
    run: Callable[[Path, list[Path] | None], list[DoctorResult]]
    fix: Callable[[Path, bool], list[DoctorResult]] | None  # dry_run param
```

The `run` callable accepts an optional `input_paths` argument. When provided, checks scope their
results to those paths only. Aggregate checks (chain, coverage) that require a full vault graph
still build the full graph but filter results to input paths.

### DoctorResult Model

```python
@dataclass
class DoctorResult:
    path: Path
    check: str          # check name
    severity: Severity  # ERROR | WARNING | INFO
    message: str
    fix_available: bool
    fix_applied: bool = False
    fix_detail: str = ""
```

### Dry-Run Contract

Every fix function accepts `dry_run: bool`. When `dry_run=True`:

- No filesystem writes occur
- Returned `DoctorResult` has `fix_applied=False`, `fix_detail` describes the planned action
- Log lines are prefixed `[DRY-RUN]`

`safe_writer.py` centralises this pattern for atomic frontmatter rewrites and file renames.

### Severity Model

| Severity | Meaning | Pre-commit behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `ERROR` | Structural violation — breaks parsing or chain integrity | Fail (exit 1) |
| `WARNING` | Advisory drift — valid but inconsistent | Pass by default, configurable |
| `INFO` | Informational — coverage gaps, style suggestions | Pass always |

Pre-commit integration uses `--severity error` by default.

### CLI Interface

```
vaultspec vault doctor [FILES...] [options]

Arguments:
  FILES                Specific files to check. If omitted, the full vault is scanned.

Options:
  -i, --input <file>   Additional file to include (repeatable; merged with positional FILES)
  --check <name>       Run only the named check (repeatable)
  --category <cat>     Run only checks in a category: links|chain|drift|coverage|structure
  --severity <level>   Minimum severity to report: error|warning|info  (default: info)
  --fix                Apply available fixes
  --dry-run            Preview fixes without writing (requires --fix)
  --json               Machine-readable JSON output
  --limit <n>          Limit items per check in output (default: 20)
  --feature <name>     Scope checks to a specific feature
```

`FILES` and `--input` are equivalent and merged. Positional args are the natural form for
pre-commit hooks (`pass_filenames: true`). `--input` / `-i` is useful for scripting.

### Check Domains and Categories

#### STRUCTURE (fast, delegates to existing)

| Check | Severity | Fixable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unsupported-dirs` | ERROR | No | Delegates to `verify_vault_structure` |
| `stray-files` | WARNING | No | Files in `.vault/` root |

#### LINKS (requires graph construction)

| Check | Severity | Fixable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `broken-wikilinks` | ERROR | No | `get_invalid_links()` wired into doctor |
| `orphaned-docs` | WARNING | No | `get_orphaned()` wired into doctor |
| `malformed-related` | ERROR | Yes | `related` entries not in `[[wikilink]]` format |

#### CHAIN (requires graph + doc-type awareness)

| Check | Severity | Fixable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `exec-plan-link` | ERROR | No | Exec `related` must contain a valid plan wikilink |
| `plan-adr-link` | WARNING | No | Plan should have at least one linked ADR |
| `adr-research-link` | WARNING | No | ADR should have at least one linked research |
| `feature-plan-coverage` | ERROR | No | Every feature tag must have a plan (existing check) |

#### DRIFT (per-file, no graph needed)

| Check | Severity | Fixable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `filename-date-drift` | ERROR | Yes | Filename date ≠ frontmatter date field |
| `filename-feature-drift` | ERROR | Yes | Filename feature ≠ feature tag |
| `unquoted-date` | WARNING | Yes | `date: 2026-02-18` (YAML date object) |
| `crlf-endings` | WARNING | Yes | Windows line endings in frontmatter |
| `duplicate-tags` | ERROR | Yes | Same tag appears more than once |
| `bom-detected` | WARNING | Yes | BOM character at file start |
| `extra-fields` | INFO | No | Frontmatter fields outside schema |
| `missing-related-field` | INFO | Yes | `related` absent; normalize to empty list |

#### COVERAGE (aggregate, no graph needed)

| Check | Severity | Fixable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature-coverage-matrix` | INFO | No | Per-feature doc-type presence/absence report |

### Pre-commit Hook Integration

`vault doctor` is the pre-commit hook entry point. With `pass_filenames: true`, pre-commit appends
staged filenames as positional args and doctor scopes all checks to those files only:

```yaml
- id: vault-doctor
  name: Vault Doctor
  entry: uv run python -m vaultspec vault doctor --severity error
  language: system
  types: [markdown]
  pass_filenames: true
```

For the heavier chain and link checks (opt-in):

```yaml
- id: vault-doctor-deep
  name: Vault Doctor (chain + links)
  entry: uv run python -m vaultspec vault doctor --category chain --category links --severity error
  language: system
  types: [markdown]
  pass_filenames: true
```

Both hooks are opt-in via the consuming project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Why No Special Category Flags (e.g. `--filenames`)

A `--filenames` shortcut flag was considered for the hook use case. It is not added because:

1. `--category drift` already covers all filename-related checks (date drift, feature drift).
2. The hook scoping problem is solved by `--input` / positional file args — the hook passes exactly
   the changed files and doctor restricts results to those files regardless of check category.
3. Adding check-type aliases (`--filenames`, `--links`) would duplicate `--category` with worse
   naming and fragment the interface.

### Relationship to `vaultspec doctor`

The existing `vaultspec doctor` (system health check) is in `core/commands.py` and covers Python
version, CUDA, and optional deps. The new `vaultspec vault doctor` is in `vault_cli.py` and covers
vault content health. The namespace distinction (`doctor` vs `vault doctor`) keeps them separate.

## Rationale

Option 2 (dedicated `vault doctor` command) is chosen because:

1. `vault audit` is removed — there is no legacy interface to preserve or be compatible with.
2. A registered-check architecture allows the suite to grow without modifying the CLI surface.
   New check domains are Python files in `doctor/checks/`, not new flags.
3. The severity model is essential for pre-commit integration. A threshold parameter solves the
   WARNING-blocks-all-commits vs WARNING-is-invisible problem cleanly.
4. Dry-run must be a first-class contract. Centralising it in `safe_writer.py` ensures every
   current and future fix respects the pattern.
5. `--input` / positional file args replace the need for a separate fast hook command or special
   category shortcut flags. One command, scoped by the caller.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Chain integrity gaps (exec→plan, plan→ADR, ADR→research) become detectable and reportable
- Frontmatter drift classes that previously passed validation are now caught
- Broken wikilinks and orphaned documents are surfaced in a unified command
- Fix operations are safe (dry-run always available, always a modifier on `--fix`)
- Feature coverage gaps are visible as a matrix
- Pre-commit hooks receive only changed files and run only relevant checks
- The check registry allows project-specific checks to be added as Python files

### Negative / Trade-offs

- New `doctor/` module and `vault doctor` CLI add surface area to document and test
- Graph construction is required for LINKS and CHAIN categories — adds ~50–200ms for large vaults
- Advisory-only checks (chain breaks without auto-fix) require human action; the suite reports
  but cannot repair missing documents
- `--input` scoping for aggregate checks (chain, coverage) still builds the full graph — file
  scoping filters results, not graph construction
